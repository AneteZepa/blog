(WIIFM)</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In learning materials, stories draw you in and can preemptively answer the most critical audience question, aka "What's In It For Me" (WIIFM): </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Why</em> should I read/watch this? <em>What</em> is the point? And <em>how</em> do I use this?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we use stories in technical communication? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We already do, often without naming it. Case studies are stories. Examples are stories. Real-world problems are stories. Even simple “before and after” explanations are stories -- they set up a situation, introduce the challenge, and then show the path to solution.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point isn’t to turn documentation into a novel or always include the history of the discovery in an explanation, but to recognize that people learn best when they can see themselves in the material.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good stories provide context, flow, clarity, and meaning. They help the learner to understand and care about the topic (hopefully) enough to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply the new learning.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next time, when you have something technical to communicate, think - would telling this as a story benefit your audience?</span></i></p><p class="msg msg--highlight">I'd love to hear your best stories - share the best piece of technical documentation or content you've seen that effectively uses a great story!</p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://AneteZepa.github.io/blog/authors/anete-zepa/" title="Anete Zepa">Anete Zepa</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://AneteZepa.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
